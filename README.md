# Letter-Counter
You enter a sentence or a word and the code counts all the letters and signs ( * - _ ^ + etc. )

For example:
Input = ["What a wonderful world"]
Outpu = [
a: 1

]

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :)
