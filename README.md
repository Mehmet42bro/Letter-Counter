# Letter-Counter
You enter a sentence or a word and the code counts all the letters and signs ( * - _ ^ + etc. )

For example:
Input = ["What a wonderful world"]
Output = [ 
  : 3
W: 1
a: 2
d: 2
e: 1
f: 1
h: 1
l: 2
n: 1
o: 2
r: 2
t: 1
u: 1
w: 2
]

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :)
